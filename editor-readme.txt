This webapp is designed to be run with webapp.sh. If you are unable to run this file, please open it in an editor and read the comments in that file.

If you do not have a pip virtual environment located in this directory, it will make one for you! If you would like to use an existing environment, you can ignore the shell script and run webapp/app.py directly. Just make sure and add all the packages from requeirments.txt to your environment before running.

If you have any recommendations for enhancing the content of this README document or require additional help with running this webapp, please do not hesitate to reach out to Gavin Ray. Your input and suggestions are greatly appreciated.
