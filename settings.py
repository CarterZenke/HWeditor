'''number_of_frames determines how many frames to extract from the GIF. 
Increasing this will save more images to static/images when a gif is uploaded. 
20 is usually enough, except in special cases where 20 just won't give a give image.'''
number_of_frames = 20 # Not yet implemented. Changing this does nothing yet!
